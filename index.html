  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I am looking for training opportunities in Web Development and Digital Skills, and remote flexible roles to work around my Web Devlopment learning schedule.<br>
    <br>
    In early 2023 completed projects in JavaScript. Now, I am actively learning html and CSS in my own time through App Brewery’s Web Development Bootcamp course through Udemy. 
    I am also familiar with Python, and C#. I am very keen to find a trainee roll where I can really immerse myself in becoming a developer.<br>
    <br>
    Having worked in many fields from Brewing to Social Work, I tried my hand at video game development during lockdown and I loved it, especially the coding aspect. 
    I am now looking to make programming my full-time career.<br>
    <br>
    I am seeking training opportunities and/or remote flexible roles which I can work around my own learning. My ideal would be a full-time paid entry level position but in the interim, I would gladly accept a part time apprenticeship or internship so I can develop my skills further.<br>
    <br>
    Please get in touch, I would love to chat about opportunities.<br>
